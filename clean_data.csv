crossed 100 day mark war ukraine ever obvious negative impact wide range issue global food crisis could last year serious problem cost living prospect world recession lack end sight war ha western leader worried uncertain best respond argument delaying russian progress even attempting defeat strengthening ukraine militarily equally quick negotiated settlement based ukrainian concession
settlement front report western pressure ha building kyiv make concession russia bring war end included former u secretary state henry kissinger comment world economic forum davos may french president emmanuel macron warning russia must humiliated
international pressure exists ukraine doe appear particularly effective however political track actual settlement remains obstructed humanitarian negotiation discussion unblocking ukrainian black sea port continue thanks turkish un mediation
ukrainian force pushed back russian military around kharkiv ukraine
nonetheless effort revive political negotiation ukraine russia way russian foreign minister sergey lavrov currently visiting turkey creates opportunity explore resuming turkish mediated negotiation recent phone call russian president vladamir putin german chancellor olaf scholz president macron urged hold direct serious negotiation ukraine president ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky ha closed door negotiation insisting recent interview war ended negotiating table
position moscow kyiv remain far apart march unlikely change side decide cannot improve position battlefield
change hardly imminent seeing ongoing battle donbas endless russian rhetoric liberating region moscow trying secure ukrainian territory entrenching control east south remains priority
ukraine often stated pushing russian force back position occupied february 24 invasion eventually restoring full sovereignty territory show sign seeking kind surrender moreover western partner including united state united kingdom continue supply ukraine weapon eu keep tightening sanction russia
fighting therefore remains intense costly side military situation ground ukraine ha changed little recent week side gaining losing territory different area along approximately 500km front line despite prediction contrary ukrainian defence collapsed ukraine ha lost ground donbas made important gain around kharkiv strengthened determination prevail russian invader
kyiv western ally agreement consolidates kremlin control russian occupied territory donbas black sea region play putin hand fact pushing defeat russia ukraine ha become key message several western capital considered best way curb future russian adventurism reassure key ally inside outside nato baltic state moldova taiwan

finally ending war ukrainian concession take two negotiate peace settlement stick pressure ukraine would insufficient bridge deep gap trust currently exists peace russia ukraine whether military victory negotiated peace deal end much wider current crisis european global security order must resolved
focus west therefore need continuing pressure russia rather ukraine may bring quick end russian invasion permanent one
